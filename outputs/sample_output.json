Customer support has been responsive when we've needed help. Overall, Zoom has significantly improved our remote work capabilities.",

    "description": "Zoom provides a solid video conferencing experience. The interface is clean and easy to navigate. We've had good experiences with the platform for both internal meetings and client calls. The recording feature is particularly useful for training sessions. The only downside is that the free version has time limitations, but the paid plans are reasonably priced for the features you get.",
