I have since learnt the store is now closed, but that did not come from their more than useless AI chatbot. You would think they are ahead of the game in this area given their affiliation with Open AI. I couldn’t get get past telling the AI assistant what I wanted. The response to my every response was “ Sorry, I didn’t get that”, no matter how slowly & eloquently I answered “Home” when asked if I wanted Home or Business support. How badly could I have pronounced that to be misunderstood? Then the chatbot offered to sms me a link to their support team. Needless to say, the sms never arrived. I’m so disillusioned that a company the size of Microsoft with their vast resources can’t get such a simple AI interface to work",
