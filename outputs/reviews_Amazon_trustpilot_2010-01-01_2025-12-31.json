We are not low enough to qualify. I have to shop price between Amazon and Walmart to get what I need for us. Why can't we get a discount too? We get $44,000 a year and our house payment just went up almost $400 a month. We both get government health insurance now since our old policy through where he retired went up almost $700 a month. We actually pay for our Medicare and Medicaid through our checks. Required by law. We don't get any relief on our house payments, taxes. We pay almost $400 a month just in groceries. Our newest car is 2001.My husband has been in 3 car accidents and 2 totaled cars in 2017. He was working over covid! The place he worked at fired him since he could no longer do the drive back and forth an hour each way. And work 14hr shifts!We are struggling too. Trying replacing 2 cars that both had just had work done on them so he could drive to work.Now he just had 3 stents done. He is diabetic and I have CFS/Fibromyalgia and back and neck injuries. Yet Bezos just had a huge rich wedding. And they expect the poor to pay $15 a month. My last order from them half should have been here today. And now not until July 5th. I was using the free prime for a month.I ordered 2 days ago. So what are people paying for? 2 items out of 10 delivered over night. What a joke. Other items not getting here on time that we have bought recently. Taking 10 days to get here.I contacted on seller and said that it's not their problem on shipping time frames. And other products incorrect. Not marked wiring which is required. And no manuals. I bought a humidfier and within the 30 days it full on leaked water everywhere! I bought a warranty and was told it didn't count since I didn't break it. What???? Products shipped paid $12 for dish soap and they were micro mini instead of full sized. And they wanted me to ship back.I was out of dish soap since it took so long to get here.Oh and Walmart also will not give seniors or disabled discounts. Again all the welfare moochers get these programs but not the tax payers. The ones who get housing, TANF, refunds on taxes, food stamps ,daycare, child support and such. And they are wearing new clothes and getting nails and hair done. Or people like Bezos having a wedding that money could have helped veterans or mentally ill homeless. He's laughing all the way to the bank! Spent 46 to 55 million on a wedding!!!!! While most of us struggle to survive.",

In the latter years I've been a Prime customer spending around £3,000 each and every year until now. Every single item that I buy I at least leave a star review but on particularly good or poor product, I actually write a review. On top of this Amazon also forward emails to me from customers who are asking specific questions about some of the goods that I have bought in the past. I have been doing this willingly and tried to help. Just recently I have been ill with progressive multiple sclerosis, and two of my sons have passed away, as my best friend of many years has too.Suddenly Amazon have notified me that I am banned from giving any more reviews or even reading reviews left by others.Nobody is telling me WHY?Any accused person surely has the right to know what they are being accused for?Surely spending apprx £45,000 with Amazon, grants me a little courtesy. I am never rude, nasty nor do I swear. Please, Amazon, tell me what on earth I have done so wrong to warrant this ban.",

        "description": "I have been a very loyal and active customer of Amazon since at least 2010. In the latter years I've been a Prime customer spending around £3,000 each and every year until now. Every single item that I buy I at least leave a star review but on particularly good or poor product, I actually write a review. On top of this Amazon also forward emails to me from customers who are asking specific questions about some of the goods that I have bought in the past. I have been doing this willingly and tried to help. Just recently I have been ill with progressive multiple sclerosis, and two of my sons have passed away, as my best friend of many years has too.Suddenly Amazon have notified me that I am banned from giving any more reviews or even reading reviews left by others.Nobody is telling me WHY?Any accused person surely has the right to know what they are being accused for?Surely spending apprx £45,000 with Amazon, grants me a little courtesy. I am never rude, nasty nor do I swear. Please, Amazon, tell me what on earth I have done so wrong to warrant this ban.",

        "description": "I am so sick and tired of everyone being able to get Prime at a discount.They let Welfare everyone get a discount that are living off of the tax payers.But for Seniors on a fixed income and me being on SSDI and going to be a senior age 60.We are considered low income but Not able to get any benefits from the state. We are not low enough to qualify. I have to shop price between Amazon and Walmart to get what I need for us. Why can't we get a discount too? We get $44,000 a year and our house payment just went up almost $400 a month. We both get government health insurance now since our old policy through where he retired went up almost $700 a month. We actually pay for our Medicare and Medicaid through our checks. Required by law. We don't get any relief on our house payments, taxes. We pay almost $400 a month just in groceries. Our newest car is 2001.My husband has been in 3 car accidents and 2 totaled cars in 2017. He was working over covid! The place he worked at fired him since he could no longer do the drive back and forth an hour each way. And work 14hr shifts!We are struggling too. Trying replacing 2 cars that both had just had work done on them so he could drive to work.Now he just had 3 stents done. He is diabetic and I have CFS/Fibromyalgia and back and neck injuries. Yet Bezos just had a huge rich wedding. And they expect the poor to pay $15 a month. My last order from them half should have been here today. And now not until July 5th. I was using the free prime for a month.I ordered 2 days ago. So what are people paying for? 2 items out of 10 delivered over night. What a joke. Other items not getting here on time that we have bought recently. Taking 10 days to get here.I contacted on seller and said that it's not their problem on shipping time frames. And other products incorrect. Not marked wiring which is required. And no manuals. I bought a humidfier and within the 30 days it full on leaked water everywhere! I bought a warranty and was told it didn't count since I didn't break it. What???? Products shipped paid $12 for dish soap and they were micro mini instead of full sized. And they wanted me to ship back.I was out of dish soap since it took so long to get here.Oh and Walmart also will not give seniors or disabled discounts. Again all the welfare moochers get these programs but not the tax payers. The ones who get housing, TANF, refunds on taxes, food stamps ,daycare, child support and such. And they are wearing new clothes and getting nails and hair done. Or people like Bezos having a wedding that money could have helped veterans or mentally ill homeless. He's laughing all the way to the bank! Spent 46 to 55 million on a wedding!!!!! While most of us struggle to survive.",

I got promised I would get a refund of the difference after recieved.I recieved the package today, contacted the customer service and got told that I the order is not eligible for getting a refund. ( Although I was told I would get a refund )Got lied to / decieving information from Amazon.com.If I knew I would be deceived by amazon I would not have placed the order. Returning the item to Amazon.It will take several days to ship it back due the fact that I don't live in the US.Unfortunately Amazon.com is not as trustable as the Amazon in my country.I hope that the can be trustable for getting my refund.....",

We are not low enough to qualify. I have to shop price between Amazon and Walmart to get what I need for us. Why can't we get a discount too? We get $44,000 a year and our house payment just went up almost $400 a month. We both get government health insurance now since our old policy through where he retired went up almost $700 a month. We actually pay for our Medicare and Medicaid through our checks. Required by law. We don't get any relief on our house payments, taxes. We pay almost $400 a month just in groceries. Our newest car is 2001.My husband has been in 3 car accidents and 2 totaled cars in 2017. He was working over covid! The place he worked at fired him since he could no longer do the drive back and forth an hour each way. And work 14hr shifts!We are struggling too. Trying replacing 2 cars that both had just had work done on them so he could drive to work.Now he just had 3 stents done. He is diabetic and I have CFS/Fibromyalgia and back and neck injuries. Yet Bezos just had a huge rich wedding. And they expect the poor to pay $15 a month. My last order from them half should have been here today. And now not until July 5th. I was using the free prime for a month.I ordered 2 days ago. So what are people paying for? 2 items out of 10 delivered over night. What a joke. Other items not getting here on time that we have bought recently. Taking 10 days to get here.I contacted on seller and said that it's not their problem on shipping time frames. And other products incorrect. Not marked wiring which is required. And no manuals. I bought a humidfier and within the 30 days it full on leaked water everywhere! I bought a warranty and was told it didn't count since I didn't break it. What???? Products shipped paid $12 for dish soap and they were micro mini instead of full sized. And they wanted me to ship back.I was out of dish soap since it took so long to get here.Oh and Walmart also will not give seniors or disabled discounts. Again all the welfare moochers get these programs but not the tax payers. The ones who get housing, TANF, refunds on taxes, food stamps ,daycare, child support and such.

        "description": "I had a terrible experience with Amazon India (Order ID: 402-5423599-4205911). My package was incomplete — one item was missing. I raised a return and was told to send the item back via self-courier.I chose DTDC and shipped it on 26th June. As per tracking, the seller received it by 30th June. But when I followed up on 26th July, I was told the courier receipt was invalid — which makes absolutely no sense.The item was delivered. The tracking was shared. Still, Amazon chose to reject the refund without proper justification. The most shocking part? The support agent abruptly disconnected my call, without giving a resolution.This shows complete disregard for customer effort and time. It’s frustrating that even after doing everything correctly, Amazon failed to support a legitimate case.If Amazon expects customers to take responsibility for self-shipping, then they must also be accountable for honoring valid delivery proofs. Highly disappointed!",

        "description": "I’ve been a loyal Amazon customer for years, but this recent experience has made me rethink that loyalty. I purchased a PC case that claimed to support my hardware (GPU and cooler), but it didn’t. After paying over $75 to return it, I was hit with a 15% restocking fee. Amazon’s response? They claimed it wasn’t the seller’s fault—without any real investigation—and even crossed out my honest 1-star review to protect the seller’s reputation.Amazon appears more interested in shielding third-party sellers than holding them accountable for misleading listings. Their so-called “A-to-Z Guarantee” means little when customers are ignored and penalized for trusting the platform.Thankfully, there are now better alternatives: • Costco Next: Leverages Costco’s reputation with trusted vendors and real member support. • Walmart+: Offers fast shipping, transparent return policies, and in-store support. • Best Buy: Provides knowledgeable staff, clear tech specs, and no-hassle returns—especially for electronics and PC parts.If Amazon continues this trend of protecting sellers at the customer’s expense, they’ll lose buyers to platforms that value fairness and transparency. Be warned: don’t assume Amazon has your back anymore.",

In the latter years I've been a Prime customer spending around £3,000 each and every year until now. Every single item that I buy I at least leave a star review but on particularly good or poor product, I actually write a review. On top of this Amazon also forward emails to me from customers who are asking specific questions about some of the goods that I have bought in the past. I have been doing this willingly and tried to help. Just recently I have been ill with progressive multiple sclerosis, and two of my sons have passed away, as my best friend of many years has too.Suddenly Amazon have notified me that I am banned from giving any more reviews or even reading reviews left by others.Nobody is telling me WHY?Any accused person surely has the right to know what they are being accused for?Surely spending apprx £45,000 with Amazon, grants me a little courtesy. I am never rude, nasty nor do I swear. Please, Amazon, tell me what on earth I have done so wrong to warrant this ban.",
